# Nuclear Cross-Section Prediction

This project implements a **polynomial regression model** in Python to predict nuclear cross-section data based on incident energy.  
The dataset used is experimental data from Hermann et al. (1999), which contains energy and corresponding renormalized cross-section values.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
2. Run the Python script
3. The program will ask you to enter an energy value in MeV.
4. The program will display the predicted cross-section.
## Necessity of the mechine learning in cross-sectional data analysis
It is often not possible to experimentally evaluate the complete cross-sectional data for a specific nuclear reaction due to limitations in laboratory facilities, measurement time, and resource availability.

Machine learning can significantly address this issue by enabling scientists to:

1. Train regression models on available experimental data.

2. Predict unknown cross-section values at energy ranges where direct measurements are not feasible.

This project is based on that concept.
It utilizes a sample dataset from experimental results and applies polynomial regression to predict cross-section values at unmeasured energy points
